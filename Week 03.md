## Week 03
### Learning Activities & Resources
This week, I reviewed the knowledge on how to use WordPress for building a website.  Since the LinkedIn educational video was too general for me, 
I watched some YouTube videos that specifically covered the additional elements needed for my website.

### Content Insights

I've noticed that WordPress relies heavily on theme templates for convenient use. Editing content without a suitable template can be inconvenient.
With a background in web design, I find Joomla more to my liking. Once you understand the logic behind Joomla's template layout, you can edit content more precisely and in a more detailed manner. In contrast, using existing themes in WordPress may have default layouts, and customization could potentially compromise the webpage layout.
While both are time-saving content management systems (CMS), my preference leans towards Joomla due to its flexibility and alignment with my design sensibilities

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights

In my learning journey, I've noticed that switching between Joomla and WordPress can be confusing. 
Comparing them repeatedly helps me understand both better. In the IT field, constant learning is key. 
Summarizing experiences is crucial for students and remains essential in professional life.
