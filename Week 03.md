## Week 03
### Learning Activities & Resources
This week, I reviewed the knowledge on how to use WordPress for building a website.  Since the LinkedIn educational video was too general for me, 
I watched some YouTube videos that specifically covered the additional elements needed for my website.

### Content Insights
I've noticed that WordPress relies heavily on theme templates for convenient use. Editing content without a suitable template can be inconvenient, and although web editing plugins are an option, they might not always be allowed.

With a background in web design, I find Joomla more to my liking. Once you understand the logic behind Joomla's template layout, you can edit content more precisely and in a more detailed manner. In contrast, using existing themes in WordPress may have default layouts, and customization could potentially compromise the webpage layout.
