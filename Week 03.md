## Week 03
### Learning Activities & Resources
This week, I reviewed the knowledge on how to use WordPress for building a website.  Since the LinkedIn educational video was too general for me, 
I watched some YouTube videos that specifically covered the additional elements needed for my website.

### Content Insights

I've noticed that WordPress relies heavily on theme templates for convenient use. Editing content without a suitable template can be inconvenient.
With a background in web design, I find Joomla more to my liking. Once you understand the logic behind Joomla's template layout, you can edit content more precisely and in a more detailed manner.
While both are time-saving content management systems (CMS), my preference leans towards Joomla due to its flexibility and alignment with my design sensibilities

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights

In my learning journey, I've observed that transitioning between Joomla and WordPress can be perplexing. 
Making repeated comparisons has enhanced my ability to comprehend both platforms. This process has improved my summarization and synthesis skills,
which I believe are crucial for future work. In the field of IT, constant learning on top of core knowledge is essential, 
as it requires adapting to and acquiring new skills.

### Group Interviews --- Findings and Experience

I crafted two interview questions focused on what employees prioritize when selecting team members. The first question asked, "What strengths make you the right fit for us?" The second inquired about handling conflicts within a team.

Surprisingly, most team members asked questions aligned with employers seeking professionals with specific skills and strong teamwork abilities. When I had to answer these questions, I felt nervous. It underscored the importance of being well-prepared not just as an interviewer but also as an interviewee, ensuring effective communication of strengths and teamwork skills.
