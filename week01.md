## Learning Activities & Resources

This week, I am revisiting my HTML knowledge, which I initially learned during my first year of website design. 
I am reviewing my assignments and refreshing my memory about constructing HTML elements and their connection to CSS.
I have realized that, being in my third year, I can quickly grasp the logical connection between HTML and CSS functions.

I have decided to begin building my basic website. Whenever I encounter difficulties with a particular part,
I review that specific section with which I am not familiar. 
I believe this approach will be more effective than going into too much detail at once.

### Resources I used:
1. CP1406 web development subject resources
2. ChatGpt
3. google research

## Estimated Hours
 4 hour to review and research the knowledge
 5 hour to build the baisc website 

## Content Insights
1. Choosing meaningful class names in HTML significantly enhances CSS file maintenance.
   
2. I personally faced challenges in identifying the appropriate class, leading to frequent checks in both files.

3. I find that organizing independent tasks within a container proves more effective and manageable in my experience.

4. Consolidating repetitive tasks into a single class streamlines CSS file maintenance, based on my own insights.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
In creating this basic website, my focus has been on the layout, functionalities, 
and content that can attract the target audience. This targeted approach made my research more purposefulâ€”I knew what I was looking for, 
making the website development process efficient. With the abundance of coding tools today, writing code isn't as challenging as conceptualizing design ideas.
I believe that the ability to think critically about design will enhance my employability and, throughout this course, I aim to continually hone this skill.
