## Content Insights

This week, I learned about the ways websites could be vulnerable to hacker attacks and the importance of particular files parameters 
when developing web pages, such as configuration files. If default parameters are used directly, the website is likely to be vulnerable to hacker attacks.
I had never paid attention to these small parameter details before. Through this week's learning, 
I realized the importance of focusing on details during the programming process. Even if a webpage looks perfect during development, 
neglecting security issues could lead to a headache if the website is compromised by hackers.


## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

I believe that if an IT professional focuses on cybersecurity during the development process, it greatly enhances the website's security, thereby saving time and resources needed for fixing security vulnerabilities later on. This not only improves project efficiency and reliability but also demonstrates their attention to detail and problem-solving skills. I believe these qualities are highly valued by employers during the hiring process. Throughout my learning journey, I aspire to continually enhance my attention to detail, which not only earns the trust of employers but also fosters greater trust from clients. This will be immensely beneficial for my career development
