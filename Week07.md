I found that my existing knowledge of Python has been a great help to me in learning PHP. 
PHP, Java, and Python share many similarities in syntax and function definitions, which allows me to learn PHP more easily leveraging my existing Python foundation. Particularly in web development, PHP's ability to mix directly with HTML makes handling web pages much more convenient. I can easily handle logic and generate dynamic content in the same file without switching to separate template files, enabling me to build dynamic web pages and web applications more quickly.
