## Content Insights
I found that Joomla can break down the whole layout into separate modules, making management and organization much simpler. 
This not only streamlines the development process but also makes it easy to find and modify the specific module when editing content,
without affecting other parts. It's way easier than searching through HTML code to make changes to the contentâ€”a very efficient way to work.
