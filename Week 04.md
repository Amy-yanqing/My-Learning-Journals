### Content Insights
This week, I find the content I need to grasp quite challenging. My understanding of terminal concepts is limited, and the environment deployment process is a bit abstract for me. Watching videos on command-line operations, especially modifying configuration files with tools like PowerShell or CMD, feels overwhelming. Much of the content on local server deployment is outdated, requiring a deeper comprehension of operational principles. Rather than just following videos, I must understand the reasons behind each step for my configuration files. Though encountering errors during learning is painful, it's a valuable process.

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights
This week, I primarily delved into the entire process of backend local deployment, gaining a clearer understanding of a developer's daily tasks. I believe this constitutes a fundamental aspect of software development and I've learned a lot. Considering my future aspirations in software development, setting up local development，staing and testing environments is crucial for me. It is likely to become a routine part of my work.
